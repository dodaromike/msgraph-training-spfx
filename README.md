# Microsoft Graph sample SharePoint Framework app

This sample demonstrates how to use the Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK to access data in Office 365 from SharePoint Framework (SPFX) applications.

> **NOTE:** This sample was originally built from a tutorial published on the [Microsoft Graph tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/tutorials) page. That tutorial has been removed.

## Prerequisites

Before you start this tutorial, you should have the following tools installed on your development machine.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/)
- [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/)
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)
- [Yeoman SharePoint generator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/yeoman-generator-for-spfx-intro)

You can find more details about requirements for SharePoint Framework development at [Set up your SharePoint Framework development environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-development-environment).

You should also have a Microsoft work or school account, with access to a global administrator account in the same organization. If you don't have a Microsoft account, you can [sign up for the Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program) to get a free Microsoft 365 subscription.

Your Microsoft 365 tenant should be [setup for SharePoint Framework development](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-developer-tenant), with an app catalog and testing site created before you start this tutorial.
